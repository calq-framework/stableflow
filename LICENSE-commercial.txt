All copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software may not be published, distributed, sublicensed, nor sold to third parties unless such copies or derivative works are part of a work that combines such copies or derivative works with other material (the "Larger Work"), or those third parties already have a valid license to use the Software.

Third parties may use copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software as an integral part of any Larger Work, but may not use any Larger Work, in whole or in part, in a way that provides substantially the same functionality as the Software, unless those third parties already have a valid license to use the Software.
